# Linear Regression Analysis in Google Colab

A Google Colab notebook that demonstrates basic data analysis, visualization, and linear regression modeling using Python libraries.

## About

This project showcases:

- Data loading and preprocessing using **pandas**
- Data visualization with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Fitting a **Linear Regression** model with **scikit-learn**
- Model evaluation

The notebook is designed as a simple example for learning and experimenting with basic regression techniques in Python.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `salesdash.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run each cell sequentially.
4. Modify the notebook to explore with your own data!

## Dependencies

- pandas
- altair
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

These are automatically available in Google Colab, or you can install them locally using:
